# Betis 2024 Webdev Open Recruitment Task
This repository contains the source file of my Fasilkom's BETIS 2024 Website Development Task. 

## For this task, I used some frameworks and libraries, for instance:
- React JS (Including React Router)
- Vite
- Underscore JS (For Mapping and Boat Sorting)
- Framer Motion (Animation and Transition)

## Some tips using the website:
- If there is no token detected in your device, then the website will direct you to ask token page.
- You can buy, read, update, and sell the boat (but please don't eat it...)

Hope it helps  ðŸ™‡ðŸ™‡
