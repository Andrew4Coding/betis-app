# Fasilkom's BETIS 2024 WebDev Open Recruitment Task 
### Nyonya Beti's Boat Collection
This repository contains the source file of my Fasilkom's BETIS 2024 Website Development Task. 

You can check the airing website: https://andrew4coding.github.io/betis-app/ or just check at the GitHub Actions Page.

## For this task, I used some frameworks and libraries, for instance:
- React JS (Including React Router)
- Vite
- Underscore JS (For Mapping and Boat Sorting)
- Framer Motion (Animation and Transition)

## Some tips using the website:
- If there is no token detected in your device, then the website will direct you to ask token page.
- You can buy, read, update, and sell the boat.
- Every time you change the color, the boat color will be changed too.

Hope it helps  ðŸ™‡ðŸ™‡
